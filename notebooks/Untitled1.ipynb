      "ABSTRACT In this paper we describe some major new additions to the STRIPS robot problem-solving system. The first addition is a process for generalizing a plan produced by SFRIPS so that problem-specific constants appearing in the plan are replaced by problem-independent para. meters. The genera!ized plan, stored m a convenient format called a triangle table, has two important functions. The more obvious function is as a single macro action that can be used by STRIPS-- either in whole or in pt \"t--durino the solution of a subsequent problem. Perhaps less obviously, the generalized plan also plays a central part in the process that monitors the real-world execution of a plan, and allows the robot to react \"intelligently\" to unexpected consequences of actions. We conclude with a discussion of experiments with the system on several example problems. \n",
      "1. Introduction In this paper we describe a system of computer programs for controlling a mobile robot. This system can conceive and execute plans enabling the robot to accomplish certain tasks such as pushing boxes from one room to another in a simple but real environment. Although these sorts of tasks are commonly thought to demand little skill or intelligence, they pose important con- ceptual probZems and can require quite complex pl~,onning arid execution strategies.

      "to the robot, STRIPS produces a plan consisting of a sequence of pre- programmed actions, and PLANEX supervises the execution of this sequence to accomplish the task. In t~ds paper we present a major new addition to the original capabilities of STRIPS and PLANEX that enables the system to generalize and then save a solution to a particular problem. This generaliza- tion capability is used in two ways. The more obvious use of a generalized plan is as~\"macro action\" that can be used as a single component of a new plan to so1~Je a new problem. When used in this fashion, generalization be- comes a p!)werful tbrm of learning that can reduce the planning time for similar tasks as well as allow the formation of much longer plans, previously beyond the combinatoric capabilities of STRIPS. The second use of generalized plans involves the supervision or monitoring of plan execution. Often, a reai-wodd robot must reexecute a portion of its plan because of some failure th,~t occurred during the first attempt at execu- tion. At such a time, the system has more flexibility if it is not rest-icted to repeating identically the unsuccessful portion of the plan, but instead can reexecute the offending actions with different arguments. Before getting into details (and defining just what we mean by generalize), we present in outline form a scenario that illustrates some of the capabilities of the system. Suppose we give a robot the task \"Close window WINDI and turn off light LITEI-2 To accomplish this, let us say that the robot decides to push box BOXI to window WINDI, climb BOXI in order to close the window, and then proceed to turn offlight LITEI. First, the system generalizes this specific plan to produce a plan that can, under certain specified conditions, close an arbitrary window (not just WINDI) and turn off an arbitrary light. Next, the system applies the appropriate version of this generalized plan tO the specific problem at hand, namely, \"'close WINDI and turn off LITEI.\" While e~,ecuting the appropriate version, let us suppose that the robot fails to push BOXI to the window because, say, it discovers another box is already under the windo~v. The PLANEX supervisor will recognize that this new box will zerve t~e purpose that BOXI was to serve, and the plan execution will proceed. Now let us suppose that, after finishing the first task, the robot is given a new problem, 'Close window WIND5 and l{~k door DOORI/\" The system is capable of recognizing that a portion of the old generalized plan ca~ help solve the new task. Thus, the sequence of several component actions needed to close the window can be readily obtained as a single macro action, and the planning time required to solve the new problem thereby reduced. We shall begin with a brief reviex*,\" of the t)roblem-solving program ST RIPS. Then we shall review a novel format for storing plans that conveniently a The sce--ario is imaginary'; our robot cam:ot actually turn off light switches or close windows.

      "allows most of the legitimate 2n - 1 subsequences of an n-step plan to be extracted as a unit in a subsequent planning activity. We then describe a process by which constants appearing in the plan can be converted to para- meters so that each plan can handle a family of different tasks. Thus general- ized, the plan can be stored (i.e., learned) for future use. Next, we review the operation of PLANEX and discuss how geneta!ized plans are used during execution to increase the system's capabilities for responding to unplanned-for situations. Finally, we discuss how STRIPS uses stored plans to compose more complex ones and describe some experiments with ~, sequence of learning tasks. 2. Summary of Strips 2.1. Description Because STRIPS is basic to our discussion, let us briefly outline its operation. (For a complete discussion and additional examples, see [1].) The ~rimitive actions available to the robot vehicle are precoded in a set of action routines. For example, execution of the routine GOTHRU(D1,RI,R2) causes the robot vehicle actually to go through the doorway DI from room R1 to room R2. The robot system keeps track of where the robot vehicle is and stores its other knowledge of the world in a model 3 composed of well-formed formulas (wfl's) in the predicate calculus. Thus, the system knows that there is a door- way DI between rooms RI and R2 by the presence of the wff CONNECTS- ROOMS(DI,R1,R2) in the model. Tasks are given to the system in the form of predicate calculus wfls. To direct the robot to go to room R2, we pose for it the goal wff INROOM(RO- BOT, R2). The planning system, STRIPS, then attempts to find a sequence of primitive actions that would change the world in such a way that the goal wit is true in the correspondingly changed model. In order to generate a plan of actions, STRIPS needs to know about the effects of these actions; that is, STRIPS must have a model of each action. The model actions are called operators and, just as the actions change the world, the operators transform one model into another. By applying a sequence of operators to the initial world model, STRIPS can produce a ~quence of models (representing hypothetica: worlds) ultimately ending ia a model in which the goal wff is true. Presumably then, execution of the sequence of actions corresponding to these operators would change the world to accomplish the task. Each STRIPS operator mus~ be cescribed in some convenient way. We characterize each operator in the repertoire by three entities: an add list, a delete list, and a preconditt'on wff. The meanings of these entities are straight- forward. An operator is applicable to a given model only if its precondition s Our use of the word \"model\" is consistent with customary terminology in Artificiei Intelligence. We hope there will be no confusion between our use of the word and its technical definition in logic, namely an interpretation for a set of formulas. Artificial Intelligence 3 (1972), 251-2S8 \n",

      "wff is satisfied in that model. The effect of applying an (assumed applicable) o~rator to a given model is to delete from the model all those clauses specified by the delete list and to add to the model all those clauses specified by the add list. Hence, the add and delete fists prescribe how an operator transforms one state into another. Within this basic framework STRIPS operates in a GPS-like manner [6]. First, it tries ~o establish that a goal wff is satisfied by a model. (STRIPS uses the QA3 resolution-based theorem prover [3] in its attempts to prove goal wits.) If the goal wff cannot be proved, STRIPS selects a \"relevant\" opera.tot that is likely to produce a model in which the goal wff is \"more nearly\" satisfied. In order to apply a selected operator the precondition wff of that operator must of course be satisfied; this precondition, becomes a new subgoal and the ptocess is repeated. At son:e point we expect to find that the pre- condition of a relevant operator is already satisfied in the current model. When this happens the operator is applied; the initial model is transformed on the basis of the add and delete lists of the operator, and the model thus created is treated in effect as a new initial model of the world. To complete our review of S'[ IPS we must indicate how relevant oper- ators are selected. An operator is needed only if a subgoal cannot be+ proved from the wits defining a model. It, this case the operators are scanned to find one whose effects would allow the proof attempt to continue. Specifically, STRIPS searches for an operator whose add list specifies clauses that would allow the proof to be s,ccessfully continued (if not completed). When an add list is found whose clauses do in fact permit an adequate continuation of the proof, then the associated operator is declared relevant; moreover, the sub- stitutions used in the proof continuation serve to instantiate at least partially the arguments of the operator. Typically, more ~han one relevant operator instance will be found. Thus, the entire STRIPS planning process takes the form of a tree search so that the consequences of considering different relevant operators can be explored. ~n summary, then, the \"inner loop\" of STRIPS works as follows: (1) Select a subgoal and try to est~Lblish that it is true in the appropriate model. If it is, go to Step 4. Otherwhe: (2) Choose as a relevant operator one whose acid list specifies clauses that allow the incomplete, proof of Step 1 to be continued. (3) The appropriatety instantiated precondition wff of the selected operator constitutes a new st~bgoal. Go to Step 1. (4) If ~he subgoal is the main genii, terminate. Otherwise, create a new model by applying the operator whose precondition is the subgoai just established. Go to Step 1. The final output of STRIPS, then, is a list of instantiated operators whose corresponding actions will achieve the goal. Artificial lnteUigence 3 (i972), 251-288 \n",

A particular member of an operator schema is obtained by instantiat.;ng all the parameters in its description to constants. It is a straightforwaJd matter to modify a resolution theorem prover to handle wffs containing parameters [1], but for present purposes we need only know that the modification ensures that each parameter can be bound only to one constant; hence, the operator arguments (which may be parameters) can assume unique values.

In other words, we wish to elevate our partic- ular plan to the status of a plan schema, or macro operator, analogous to the primitive operators we were given initiallyÂ Moreover, we would like to store a macro operator in such a way as to make any of its legitimate subsequences also available to STRIPS.

      "PLANEX, the system responsible for monitoring the execution of plans ? In what form should it be saved? For purposes of monitoring execution, PLANEX needs at every step to be able to answer such questions as (a) Has the portion of the plan executed so far produced the expected results ? (b) What portion of the plan needs to be executed next so that after its execution the task will be accomplished ? (c) Can this portion be exect,ted in the current state of the world ? Also, for purposes of saving plans so that portions of them can be used in a later planning process, we need to know the preconditions and effects of any portion of the p;an. If we are to have efficient methods for answering Questions (a)-(c), we must store a plan in a way tha~ plainly reveals its internal structure. In par- ticelar, we must be able to identify the role of each operator in the overall plan: what its important effects are (as opposed to side effects) and why these effects are needed in the plan. To accomplish this, we decided to store plans in a tabular form called a triangle table.'~ A triangle table is a lower triangular array where rows and ~olumns cG-~'espond to the operators of the plan. An example of a triangle table is shown in Fig. 1. (The reader may tempo- rarily ignore the heavily outlined rectangleÂ°) The columns of the table, with the exception of Column zero, are labelled with the names of the operators of the plan, in this example OPt,Â..,    OP4. For each Column i, i                                                                -  ~,~..   ., 4, we place in the top cell the add list A~ of operator OPt.

Thus, A 1/2 denotes those clauses in At not deleted by OPz; At/z,3 denotes those clauses in A~jz not deleted by OPt. and so forth. Thus, the ijth cell of the matrix contains those wffs added by the jth operator that are still true at the time of application of the ith operator. We can now interpret the c,)ntents of the ith row of the table, excluding the left-most column. Since ea~:h cell in the ith row (excluding the left-most) contains statements added by one of the first (i- 1) operators but not deleted by any of those operators, we see that the union of the cells in the ith row (excluding the left-most) specifies the add list obtained by applying the (i - l)st ;:cad of the plain; i.e., by applying in sequence OPt,..., OP~_I. We denote by A~  .....  j the add list achieved by the first j operators applied in sequence. The union of the ceil~; in the bottom row of a triangle table evidently specifies the add list of the complete sequence.

First, notice that Kernel l-- that is, the left-most column of a triangle table--constitutes a set of sufficient conditions for the applicability of the entire plan. Thus, we can take the conjunction of the clauses in Column 0 to be a precondition formula for the whole plan. A second observation may help the reader gain a little more insight into the structure of triangle tables. Consider again the table of Fig. 1, and let us suppose this time that Kernel 2 is true. Since Kernel 2 is true, the sequence OP2, OP3, OP4 is applicable. Upon applying OP2, which is immediately applicable because the marked clauses in Row 2 are true, we effectively add Column 2 to the table. Moreover, we lose interest in Row 2 because 0t'2 has atready been applied. Thus the application of OP2 transforms a true Kernel 2 into a true Kernel 3, and the application of the operators in the tail of the plan can continue. \n",
      "4. Generalizing Plans 4.1. Motivation The need for plan generalization in a learning system is readily apparent. Consider the specific plan produced in the example of Section 2: GOTHRU(DI,RI,R2) PUSHTHRU(BOXI,DI,R2,R1). While this sequence solves the original task, it probably doesn't warrant being saved for the future unless, of course, we expe.ct that the robot would often need to go from Room RI through Door Di to Room R2 to push back the specific box, BOXI, through Door DI into Room RI. We would like to generalize the plan so that it could be free from the specific constants, DI, RI, R2, and BOXI and could be used in situations involving arbitrary doors, rooms, and boxes. In consi,~ering possible pro,~edures for generalizing plans we must first reject the naive suggestion of merely replacing each constant in the plan by a parameter. Some of the constants may really need to have specific values in order for the plan to work at all. For example, consider a modification of our box-t~tching plan in which the second step of the plan is an operator that on!y pushes objects from room _R2 ifao room RI. The specific plan might then be GOTHRU(DI~R1,R2) SPECIALPUSH(BOX 11). Artificial Intelligence 3 (1972), 251-288 \n",

      "When we generalize this plan we cannot replace all constants by parameters, since the plan only works when the third argument of GOTHRU is R2. We would want ot.~r procedure to recoguize this fact and produce the plan GOTHRU(dl,rI,R2) SPECIALPUSH(bl). Another reason for rejecting the simple replacement of constants by para- meters is that there is often more genera!ity readily available in many plans than this simple procedure will extract. For example, the form of our box- pushing plan, GOTHRU followed by PUSHTHRU, does not require that the room in which the robot begins be the same room into which .he box is pushed. Hence the plan could be generalized as follows: GOTHRU(dl,rl,r2) PUSHTHRU(b,d2,r2,r3) and be used to go from one room to an adjacent second room and push a box to an adjacent third room. Our plan-generalizat\" m procedure overcomes these difficulties by taking into account the internal structure of the plan and the preconditions of each operator. The remainder of this section is a de~ription of this generalization procedure. \n",
      "4.2. The Generalization Procedure The first step in our generalization procedure is to \"lift\" the triangle table to its most general form as follows: We first replace every occurrence of a constant in the clauses of the left-most column by a new parameter. (Multiple occurrences of the same constant are replaced by distinct parameters.) Then the remainder of the table is filled in w~th appropriate add clauses assuming completely uninstantiated operators (i.e., as these add clauses appear in the operator descriptions), and assuming the same deletions as occurred in the original table. As an example, Fig. 3 shows the table from Fig. 2 in its most general form. The lifted table thus obtained is too general; we wish to constrain it so that the marked clauses in each row support the preconditions of the operator on that row, while retaining the property tkat the lifted table has the original table as an instance. To d~.~termine the constraints we redo each operator's precondition proof using the support clauses in the lifted table as axioms and the precondition formulas from the operator descriptions as the theorems to be proved. Each new proof is constructed as an isomorphic image of STRIPS' original preconditions proof by Ferforming at each step resolutions on the same clauses and unifications on the same literals as in the original proof. This proof process ensures that each original proof is an instance of the new Artificial Intelligence 3 (1972), 251-288 \n",

Any substitutions of para- meters for constants or for other parameters in the new proofs act as con- straints or, the generality of the plan and must be reflected in the lifted table.

The first step eliminates some cases of overgeneralization produced during the lifting process and therefore makes more efficient the use of the plan by STRIPS and PLANEX. Often a clause in a plan's initial model will he in the support set of more than c.le operator, and therefore will appear more than once in Column 0 of the triangle table. When the table is lifted, each occurrence of the clause will generate new parameters. For example, in Fig. 3, CONNECTS(DI,RI,R2) was lifted to CONNECTS- (p3,p4,pS) and to CONNECTS(p8,pg,pl0).

For example, consid,~r a case in which INROOM(BOXI,RI) appears twice in Column 0 of a triangle table. When the table is lifted, the occurrences of the clause in Column 0 might become INROOM(pl,p2) and INROOM(p3, p4). If the precondition proofs cause pl to be substituted for p3, but do not constrain p2 and p4, then we have a plan whose preconditions include the clauses INROOM(pl,p2) and INROOM(pl,p4). Therefore we have a plan whose preconditions allow Object pl to be in two, distinct rooms at the same tin~e, even though we know that iq 8ny se.manti- tally correct model Object pl will be in only one room. We eliminate most cases of this overgeneralization by recognizing those cases where two parameters are produced from a single occurrence of a constant in a single clause; if both such parameters do not appear as argu- ments of operators in the plan, then they can be bound together and one substituted for the other throughout the table without effectively inhibiting the generality of the plan.

      "The source of this embarrassment hes in the assumption made above that the deletions in the lifted table can be the same as in she unlifted table. In our example, the clause AT(boxl,locl) should be deleted by the PUSH(box2, 1oc2) operator in the case where box1 and box2 are bound to the same object, bm not deleted otherwise. Using the deletion algorithm described below, we represent this situation in the lifted table by replacing the clause AT(boxl, loci) in Row 3 by the clause form of boxl :~ box2 ~ AT(boxl,locl) as shown in Fig. 5(c). This implication serves us well since the thecrer~ prover can ded uce AT(boxl,loc 1) as being part of the plan's additions list for exactly those cases in which boxl and box2 are distinct. We now consider in general how deletions are correctly accounted for in the lifted triangle tables. After all the precondition proofs are redone for the lifted table, the delete list of each operator is considered beginning with the first operator and continuing in sequence through the plan. The delete list of the ith operator is applied to )he clauses in Pew i of the table to determine which clauses should appear in Row i + 1 of the table,s Recall that an operator's delete list is specified to STRIPS as a list of literais, and any clause that unifies with one of these literals is deleted. Application of the delete list will cause the lifted table to be modified only when a unification with a delete literal requires that a parameter pl be replaced by another parameter p2 or by a constant CI. in that case the clause will unify with the delete literal only when pl and p2 are instantiated to the same constant or when p! is instantiated to CI. Hence the clause is replaced in the next row of the table by an implication as follows: pl ~ p2 ~ clause   or pl :~ CI ~ clause. This implication allows the theorem prover to deduce the clause in only those cases where the operator's delete list would not have deleted it from the model. If the clause that is replaced by the implication in a conditional deletion is part of the support of an operator in the plan (i.e., the clause is marked), then the implication must be accompanied by another addition to the table. In particular, if a clause CLI is part of the support for thejth operator of the plan and CLI is replaced in Row j of the table by the implication pl p2 ~ CLI, then pl # p2 must be added as a marked clause to Cell (j, 0) ofthe table. This addition to the table ensures that thejth operator's preconditions can be proved from the marked clauses in Row j of the table. The precot~.- ditions proof previously obtained will remain valid with the addition of a s This characterization of the deletion applications requires that we include in Cell (1, O) of the table all the clauses that appear anywhere in Column 0. The resulting redundant occurrences of Column 0 clauses can be edited out before the table is stored. 21                                    Artificial Intelligence 3 0972), 251-288 \n",

      "5. Execution Strategies 5.1. Requirements for the P|an Executor In this section we shall des~:ribe how a program called PLANEX uses triangle tables to monitor the execution of plarts. An early version of PLANEX was described by likes [2]. It is now being used in conjunction with STRIPS and the MACROP generation procedures to control the SRI robot [4]. One of the novel elements introduced into a~'tificial intelligence research by work on robots is the study of execution strategies and how they interact with planning activities. Since robot plans must ultimately be executed in the real world by a mechanical device, as opposed to !~ing carried out in a mathe- matical space or by a sir~ulator, consideration m:~st be given by the executor to the possibility that operations in the plan may not accomplish what they were intended to, that data obtained from sensory devices may be iwtccurate, and that mechanical tole:rances may introduce errors as the plan is executed. Many of these problems of plan execution would disappear if our system generated a whole new plan after each execution step. Obviously, such a strategy would be too costly, so we instead seek a plan execution scheme with the following properties: (1) When new information obtaitied during plan execution implies that some remaining portion of the plan need not be executed, the executor should recognize such information and omit the unneeded plan steps. (2) When execution of some po~ion of the plan fails to achieve the intended results, the executor shoulcJ recognize the failure and either direct reexecution of some portion of the plan or, as a default, call for a replanning activity. \n",
      "5.2. Preparation of rite MACROP for Exeetttion Rather than working with the specific version of the plan originally produced by STRIPS, PLANEX uses the generalized MACROP to guide execution. The generalized plan allows a modest amount of replanning by the executor should parts of the plan fail in certain ways. Before a MACROP can be used by PLANEX, its parameters must be partially instantiated using the spe~.~fLc constants of the goal wff. This special- izes the MACROP to the specific task at hand while it leaves as general as possible the conditions under which i~t can be executed.

      "table those clauses from the origina~ model that were used by STI~APS in proving the goal wff. Then we use all of the daubs in the entire last row of the MACROP to prove the goal wff. Thoae substitutions made during this proof are then made on the entire MACROP. In addition we mark those clauses in the last row of the MACROP that were used to support the goal wff proof. This version of the MACROP is the one used to control execu- tion.~ Let us illustrate what we have said about preparing a MACROP for execution by considering our example of fetching a box. In Fig. 4, we have the MACROP for this task. In Section 2, the goal wfffor this task was given as (3x)[BOX(x) ^ INROOM(x, R1)].

      "5.3. The PI,ANEX Execution Strategy Our strategy for monitoring the execution of plans makes use of the kernels of the execution MACROP. Recall that the/th kernel of a triangle table for an n-step plan is the unique rectangular subarray containing Row i and Cell (n + 1, 0). The importance of the ith kernel stems from the fact that it con- tains (as marked clauses) the support of the preconditions for the ith tail of the plan--that is, for the operator sequence {OPt,..., OPn}. Thus if at some stage of plan execution the marked clauses in the ith kernel are provable, then we know that the ith tail is an appropriate operator sequence for achieving the goal. At each state of execution we must have at least one true kernel if we are to continue execution of the plan. At the beginning of execution we know that the first kernel is true, since the initial model was used by STRIPS when the plan was created. But at later stages, unplanned outcomes might place us either unexpectedly close to the goal or throw us off the track completely. Our present implementation adopts a rather optimistic bias;. We check each kernel in turn starting with the highest r.umbered one (which is the last row of the MACROP) and work backwards from the goal until we find a kernel that is true. If the goal kernel (the last row) is true, execution halts; otherwise we determine if the next-to- last kernel is true, and so on, until we find a true kernel k~ and a corresponding tail of the plan {OPi,. Â., OP,}. The execution strategy then executes the action corresponding to OPt and checks the outcome, as before, by searching for the highest-numbered true kernel. In an \"ideal\" world this procedure merely executes in order each operator inthe plan. On the other hand, the procedure has the freedom to omit execution of unnecessary operators and to overcome failures by repeating the execution of operators. Replanning by STRIPS is initiated when no kernels are true.7 When checking to see if a kernel is true, we check to see if some it~stance of the conjunction of marked clauses in the kernel can be proved from the present model. Once such an instance is found, we determine the corresponding instance of the first operator in the tail of the plan and execute the action corresponding to that instance. Thus the generality of representation of the execution MACROP allows a great deal of flexibility in plan execution. For example, consider a ca~e where PLANEX is executing a plan ft',at takes the robot from one room through a second room into a third room. If, when the robot attempts to go through the door connecting the second and third rooms, the door is found to be locked, then PLANEX may be able to  Typically, when replanwing is necessa~T it is sufficient to produce a short sequence of operators to \"'get I~ack onto the trek\" of the original plan. Since STRIPS has the M#.C- ROP for the original plan in its repertoire of operators, the new plan can often be formed by composing a sequence .of operators wnd appending it to an appropriate tail of the MACROP.

      "reinstantiate parameters so that the first part of the plan can be reexecuted to take the robot from the second room through some new fourth room and then into the target third room. An interesting by-product of our optimistic strategy of examining kernels in backwards order is that PLANEX sometimes remedies certain blunders made by STRIPS. Occasionally, STRIPS produces a plan containing an entirely superfluous subsequence--for example, a subsequence of the form OP, OP-1, where OP-t precisely negates the effects of OP. (Such a \"detour\" in a olan would reflect inadequacies in the search heuristics used by STRIPS.) Du.~ing plan execution, however, PLANEX would effectively recognize that the state following OP-~ is the same as the state preceding OP, and would therefore not execute the superfluous subsequence. \n",
      "5.4. The PLANEX Scanning Algorithm The triangle table is a compact way of representing the kernels of a MAC- ROP; most cells of the table occur in more than one kernel. We have exploited this economy of representation by de;igning an efficient algorithm for finding the highest-numbered true kernel. This algorithm, called the PLANEX scan, involves a cell-by-cell scan of the triangle table. We give a brief description of it here and refer the reader to Fikes [2] for more details. Each cell exam- ined is evaluated as either True (i.e., ~il ~he marked clauses are provable from the current model) or False. The interest of the algorithm stems from the order in which cells are examined. Let us call a kernel \"potentially true\" at some stage in the scan if all evaluated cells of the kernel are true. The scan algo- .-i;.hm can then be succinctly stated as: Among all unevaluated cells in the highest-indexed potentially true kernel, evaluate the left-most. Break \"'left- most ties\" arbitrarily. The reader can verify that, roughly speaking, this table-scanning rule results in a left-to-right, bottom-to-top so.an of the table. However, the table is never scanned to the right of any cell already evaluated as false. An equivalent statement of the algorithta is \"Among all unevaluated cells, evaluate the cell common to the largest number of potentially true kernels. Break ties arbitrarily.\" We conjecture that this scanning algorithm is optimal in the sense that it evaluates, on the average, fewer cells than any other scan guaCanteed always to find the highest true kernel. A proof of this conjecture has not been foand. As the cells in the table are scanned we will be making substitutions for the MACROP parameters as dictated by the proofs of the cells' clauses. It is important to note that a substitution made to establish the truth of clauses in a particular cell must be applied to the ent;~re table. When there are alternative choices about which substitutions to make, we keep a tree of possibilities so that backtracking can occur if needed. Artificial l~,.telligence 3 (1972), 251-288 \n",

      "6.1. Extracting a Relevant Operator Sequence from a MACROP Recall that the (i + l)st row of a triangle table (excluding the first cell) represents the add list, At  .....  l, of the ith head of the plan, i.e. of the sequence OPt,..., OPi. An n-step plan presents STRIPS with n alternative add lists, any one of which can be used to reduce a difference encountered during the normal planning process. STRIPS tests the relevance of each of a MACROP's add lists in the usual fashion, and the add lists that provide the greatest reduction in the difference are selected. Often a given set of relevant clauses will appear in more than one row of the table. In that case only the lowest-numbered row is selected, since this choice results in the shortest operator sequence capable of producing the desired clauses. Suppose that STRIPS selects the ith add list AI  .....  ~, i < n. Since this add list is achieved by applying in sequence OPt,..., OPi, we will obviously not be interested in the application of OPt+t,..., OP,,, and will therefore not be interested in establishing any of the preconditions for these operators. Now in general, some steps cÂ¢ a plan are needed only to establish preconditions for subsequent steps. If ~e lose interest in a tail of a plan, then the relevant instance of the MACROP need not contain those operators whose sole purpose is to establish preconditions for the gaff. Also, STRIPS will, in general, have used only ,,;ome subset of A t  .....  ~ in establishing the relevance of the ith head of the plan. Any of the first ioper, ors that does not add some clause in this subset, or help establish the preconditions for some operator that adds a clause in the subset is not needed in the relevant instance of the MACROP. Conceptually, then, w~ can think ofa single triangle table as representing a family of generalized operators. Upon the selection by STRIPS of a relevant add list, we must extr~,ct from this family an economical parameterized operator achieving the add list. In the following paragraphs, we will explain by means of an example an editing 'algorithm for accomplishing this task of operator extraction. \n",

      "These clauses have been indicated on the table by an asterisk (*). The editing algorithm proceeds by examining the table to determine what effects of individual operators are not needed to produce Clauses 16 and 25. First, OPT is obviously not needed; we can therefore remove all circle marks from gow 7, since those marks indicate the support of the preconditions of OPT. We now inspect the columns, beginning with Column 6 and going from fight to left, to find the first column with no marks of either kind (circles or asterisks). Column 4 is the first such column. The absence of marked clauses in Column 4 means that the clauses added by OP,~ are not needed to reduce the difference and are not required to prove the We-condition of any subsequent operator; hence 01'4 will not be in the edited operator sequence and we can unmark all clauses m Row 4. Continuing our right-t~Ieft scan of the columns, we note that Column 3 contains no marked clauses. (Recall that we have already unmarked Clause 18.) Vie therefore delete OP3 from the plan and unmark all clauses in Row 3. Continuing the scan, we note that Column 1 contains no marked entries (we have already unmarked Clause 11), and therefore we can delete OPt and the markect entries in Row 1.

We have some:latitude though, in specifying tbe preconditions of the MACROP. An obvious choice would be to use the conjunction of the clauses in the left-most column, but there is a difficulty wit[, this straightforward choice that can be made clear with the aid of a simple ~xample. Suppose we are currently in a state in which the first kernel of an extited MACROP--that is, its left-most column--is false, but suppose further that, say, the third kernel is true. Since the third kernel is true, the tail of the MACROP beginning with OP3 is immediately applicable and would produce the desired relevant additions to the' model. If STRIPS were to ignore this opportunity and set up the left-most column of the MACROP as a subgoal, it would thereby take the proverbial one step backward to go two steps forward. This example suggest,,; that we employ a PLANEX scan on the edited table Artificial Intelligence 3 (1972), 251-288 \n",

      "so that all tails of the relevant MACROP will be tested for applicability. If an applicable tail is found, STRIPS applies, in sequence, each operator in this tail to produce a new planning model. Each operator application is performed in the usual manner using the add and delete lists of the individual operators. If the PLANEX scan fails to find a true kernel, then no tail is applicable and the conjunction of the marked clauses in the first kernel is set up as a subgc~al to be achieved by STRIPS. Actually, any kernel would constitute a perfectly good subgoal and, in principle, the disjunction of all the kernels would be better still. Unfortunately, this disjunction places excessive demands on both the theorem prover and the STRIPS executive, so we restrict ourselves to consideration of the first kernel. We have seen that STRIPS uses a MACROP during planning by extracting a relevant subsequence of the MACROP's operators, and then including that subsequence in the new plan being constructed. When the new plan is made into a MACROP it is often the case that it will contain add lists that are subsets of add lists in already existing tables. For example, if an entire existing MACROP is used in the construction of a new plan, and the para- meter substitutions in the new MACROP corre:;pond to those in the old MACROP, then each add list in the old MACROP will be a subset of an add list in the new MACROP. To assist STRIPS in its u~se of MACROPS, we have designed a procedure that will remove redundant acid lists from consideration during planning, and in eases where an entire MACROP is contained within another, will delete the contained MACROP front the system. Our procedure takes the following action: If\" every instance of the operator sequence that is the ith head of some MACROP is also an instance of a sequence occurring anywhere else in the same or sc,me other MACROF, then all the add lists in that head (i.e. Rows 2 through i + 1) are disallowed for consideration by STRIPS.s For example, consider the following two gene~-al- ized plans: Plan A:OPA(pl),OPB(pl,p2),OPC(p3),OPD(p3,CI),OPA(p3),OPB(p4,pS) Plan B: OPC(p6),OPD(p6,C l),OPA(pT),OPF(lc6,pT}. Rows 2 and 3 of Plan A are disallowed for consideration as add ~ists since every instance of the sequence, OPA(pl),OPB(pl,p2), is also an ins1:ance of the sequence, OPA(p3),OPB(p4,pS), that occurs at the end el\" Plan A. Rows 2 and 3 of Plan B are disallowed because of the sequence, OPC(p3),OPD- (p3,Cl), that occurs in Plan A. ~'qote that Row 4 of Plan B could not be disallowed for consideration by Plan A since there are instances of the se- quence, OPC(p6),OPD(p6,CI),OPA(pT), that are not instances of OPC(p3), OPD(p3,CI),OPA(p3). This procedure is applied whenever a new M ~CROP is added to the system. It has proved to be quite effective at minimizing the number of s Note that the first row of a MACROP contains no add clauses. drtiflcia/Intelligence 3 (I 972), 2 51-288 \n",

A difficulty arises in the use of this procedure when the same operator appear.$ in two MACROPs and the support sets for the precond;tion proofs of that operator differ markedly in the two triangle tables. This can occur, for example, when the precondition is a disjunction of two wtTs and in one case the first disjunct was proven to be true and in the other case the second disjunct was proven to be. true. In those situations the two occurrences of the operator shouid not be considered as instances of the same operator since each occurrence effectively:had different preconditions.

STRIPS' attention was directed to the rooms shown in the diagrams by closing the doors connecting all other room~. The plan for the first problem in the sequence pushes two boxes together and then takes the robot i;~to an adjacent room. The second problem is similar to the first except that d.~fferent rooms and different boxes are involved, and the robot begins in a room adja~nt to the room containing the boxes. STRIPS uses a tail of MACROPI to get the robot into the room with the boxes and then uses the entire MACROPI to complete the plan. The third problem involves taking the robot from one room through a second room and into a third room, with the added complication that the door connecting the second and third rooms is closed. STRIPS first decides to use MACROP2 with the box-pushing sequence edited out and then finds that the door must be opened; to get ~he robot next to the closed door, a head of MACROP2 is selected with the box-pushing sequence a~in edited out. After formation of the plan to go t~ the door and open it, the PLANEX scan observes that only the final operator of the first relevant instance of MAC- ROP2 is needed to complete the plan. The fourth problem require~-f~at three boxes be pushed together, with the robot beginning in a room adjacent to the room containing the boxes. A head of MACROP2 is used to get the robot into the room with the boxes and to push two of them together; the box-pushing sequence of MACROP2 is used to complete the plan, again with the assistance of the PLANEX scan. The fifth problem requires the robot to go from one room into a second room, open a door that leads into a third room, go through the third room imo a fourth room, and then push together two pairs of boxes. The plan, which is formeci by oombining all of MACROP4 with all of MACROP3, is well beyond the range of plans producible by STRIPS without the use of MACROPs. Note that although MACROP4 was created by lifting a plan that pushed three boxes together, it. has enough generality to handle this form of a four-box problem. Note alsn that MACROPI, MACROP3, and MACROP4 have been recognized a~ redundant and deleted, so that the net result of this learning sequence is to ~.dd only MACROP2 and MACROP5 to the system. In Table I we present a table' showing the search tree sizes and running times for the five problems. The: problems were run both with and without the use of MACROPs for comparison. Even when MACROPs were not being used for planning we include the MACROP production time since PLANEX needs the MACROP to monitor plan execution. Note that the times and the search tree sizes are all smaller when MACROPS are used and that the MACROPs allow longer phns to be formed without necessarily incurring an exponential increase in planning time.

      "robot environment that culminated in the production of a 19-operator plan for fetching three boxes from three different rooms and then pushing the three boxes together. This final MACROP s,Jbsumed the seven earlier ones so that only one MACROP was retained by the system. Subsequences of the 19-step MACROP could be used to fetch boxes, push boxes together, move the robot from room to room, etc. The experiments we have been discussing show the use of MACROPs during planning. We have also run e~periments with PLANEX to illustrate the use of MACROPs during plan execution. One such experiment is docu- mented in a report [4] and film [5] that illustrate how PLANEX monitors robot task execution in the seven-room experimental environment. One interesting sequence in this experiment involves the robot attempting to go from one room through a second room into a third room. After entering the second room, the robot discovers that a box is blocking the door that leads into the third room. Since PLANEX is working with a generalized plan, the difficulty can l~e overcome by finding a different instance of the plan's first kernel that is satisfied. This new insmntiation of the plan's parameters causes the robot to be sent from the second room into a fourth room and then into the target third room. 8. Conclusions We have presented in considerable detail methods by which a problem- solving program can \"learn\" old solutions and use them both to monitor real-world execution and to aid in the solution of new problems. We view these methods as representing only a preliminary excursion into an area that, in the long run, may ht~ld high potential for the design of \"intelligent\" robots. Before such potential is realized, however, there are a number of substantial technical problems to t~; solved; in this final section we briefly point out a few of these. \n",
      "8.1. Abs|racting Preconditions It is a commonplace observation thor successful problem solvers (human or machine) must plan at a level of detail appropriate to the problem at hand. In typical problem-solving programs, the level of detail is set a priori by the experimenter when he carefully selects the representations employed. This situation changes when the problem solver can create its own MAC- ROPS. Now we have the possibi|ity of creating powerful macro operators whose specification is at the same level of detail as each component operator. In terms of our system, we may create a large triangle table whose precon- ditions (its first kernel) is the conjcnction of so many literals that the theorem prover has little hope of success. What we need is a way of appropriately Artificial Intelligence 3 (1972), 251-288 \n",

      "abstracting the preconditions of a MACROP so that only its \"main\" pre- condition~ remain. A plan woald first be attempted using these abstract preconditions; if successful, a subsequent planning process would fill in the details (and perhaps suggest changes to the abstract plan) as needed. As a rough example of the sort of process we have in mind, suppose we have a MACROP that requires the robot to travel through several doors. An abstract precondition for the MACROP might not contain the requirement that the doors be open on the supposition that, should they be closed, the robot could easily open them at the appropriate time. In whatever manner such a scheme is ultimately implemented, it seems clear that a problem solver will be able to increase its power with experience only if it can use this experience at an appropriate level of abstraction. \n",
      "8.2. Saving MACROPS We discussed previously a method for discarding a MACROP when it is subsumed by another, more powerful MACROP. In general, any system that learns plans must also either incorporate a mechanism for forgetting old plans or else face the danger of being swamped by an ever-increasing repel', toire of stored plans. One straightforward approach to this problem would be to keep some statistics on the frequencies with which the various MACROPS are used, and discard those that fall below some threshold. We have not, howerer, experimented with any such mechanisms. \n",
      "8.3. Other Forms of Learning The generalization scheme discussed in this ~aper is but one of many possible forms of machine learning. Another form ~of learning that would be inter- esting to investigate involves reconciling predicted and observed behavior. Suppose, by way of example, that an operator OP is originally, thought to add Clause C whenever it is applied, but suppose we notice that the action corresponding to OP consistently fails to add C. We would like the system to remedy this situation by taking one of three steps: drop C from the add list of OP, restrict the preconditions of OP to those (if any) that guarantee that C is added by the action, or change the actual action routine so that it does in fact behave as originally advertised. While we offer no algorithms for accomplish- ing these forms of learning, it is interesting to note that the problem itself arises only when we deal with real, as opposed to simulated, robot systems. It is the occurrence of problems of this sort that persuades us of the contin- uing inferest and importance of robot problem solving. \n",
